Questions: (February 8, 2026)
1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?

> It contains 10 different categories such as T-shirts, trousers, shoes, and bags.
It is commonly used to train and test machine learning models, especially as a more challenging replacement for the original MNIST digit dataset.

2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?

> We normalize image pixel values to scale them from 0–255 down to 0–1.
This helps the neural network learn faster and more efficiently.
Normalization also improves numerical stability and leads to better model accuracy during training.

3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.

>The neural network has three layers. The Flatten layer changes the 28×28 image into a one-dimensional list so the model can read it. 
The Dense hidden layer with ReLU activation learns patterns and features from the images and helps the model understand complex relationships. 
The Dense output layer has 10 neurons, one for each clothing 

4. What does an epoch mean in model training?
> An epoch means the model has seen all training images once. Each epoch helps the model improve by adjusting its weights. 
Training for more epochs can improve accuracy, but too many can cause overfitting.

5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.

> The predicted label is the class chosen by the model based on the highest probability.
The actual label is the true class from the dataset.
If both labels are the same, the model made a correct prediction; if not, it made a mistake.

6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?

>The model’s accuracy can be improved by changing the number of neurons, adding more hidden layers, or training for more epochs. 
Using more advanced models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also give better results.

Tasks Enhancement:
1. Change the number of neurons in the hidden layer (e.g., 64 or 256) and retrain the model.
2. Increase the number of epochs and observe changes in accuracy.
3. Add another hidden layer and compare the results.

> After changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer from 128 to 286, the model was able to learn more detailed features, which can improve accuracy but also increases training time. 
Increasing the number of epochs helped the model learn better at first, but too many epochs may cause overfitting.
Adding an extra hidden layer allowed the model to learn more complex patterns and usually gave better accuracy than a simpler model, although it made the network more complex and slower to train.
